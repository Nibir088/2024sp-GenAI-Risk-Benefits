### Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey
  + https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10997
  + Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate powerful capabilities, but they still face challenges in practical applications, such as hallucinations, slow knowledge updates, and lack of transparency in answers. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) refers to the retrieval of relevant information from external knowledge bases before answering questions with LLMs. RAG has been demonstrated to significantly enhance answer accuracy, reduce model hallucination, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks. By citing sources, users can verify the accuracy of answers and increase trust in model outputs. It also facilitates knowledge updates and the introduction of domain-specific knowledge. RAG effectively combines the parameterized knowledge of LLMs with non-parameterized external knowledge bases, making it one of the most important methods for implementing large language models. This paper outlines the development paradigms of RAG in the era of LLMs, summarizing three paradigms: Naive RAG, Advanced RAG, and Modular RAG. It then provides a summary and organization of the three main components of RAG: retriever, generator, and augmentation methods, along with key technologies in each component. Furthermore, it discusses how to evaluate the effectiveness of RAG models, introducing two evaluation methods for RAG, emphasizing key metrics and abilities for evaluation, and presenting the latest automatic evaluation framework. Finally, potential future research directions are introduced from three aspects: vertical optimization, horizontal scalability, and the technical stack and ecosystem of RAG.

+ Table reasoning, which aims to generate the corresponding answer to the question following the user requirement according to the provided table, and optionally a text description of the table, effectively improving the efficiency of obtaining information. Recently, using Large Language Models (LLMs) has become the mainstream method for table reasoning, because it not only significantly reduces the annotation cost but also exceeds the performance of previous methods. However, existing research still lacks a summary of LLM-based table reasoning works. Due to the existing lack of research, questions about which techniques can improve table reasoning performance in the era of LLMs, why LLMs excel at table reasoning, and how to enhance table reasoning abilities in the future, remain largely unexplored. This gap significantly limits progress in research. To answer the above questions and advance table reasoning research with LLMs, we present this survey to analyze existing research, inspiring future work. In this paper, we analyze the mainstream techniques used to improve table reasoning performance in the LLM era, and the advantages of LLMs compared to pre-LLMs for solving table reasoning. We provide research directions from both the improvement of existing methods and the expansion of practical applications to inspire future research.
