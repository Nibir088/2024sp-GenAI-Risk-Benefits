### On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?
  + https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922
  + The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.

### Low-Resource Languages Jailbreak GPT-4
+ AI safety training and red-teaming of large language models (LLMs) are measures to mitigate the generation of unsafe content. Our work exposes the inherent cross-lingual vulnerability of these safety mechanisms, resulting from the linguistic inequality of safety training data, by successfully circumventing GPT-4's safeguard through translating unsafe English inputs into low-resource languages. On the AdvBenchmark, GPT-4 engages with the unsafe translated inputs and provides actionable items that can get the users towards their harmful goals 79% of the time, which is on par with or even surpassing state-of-the-art jailbreaking attacks. Other high-/mid-resource languages have significantly lower attack success rate, which suggests that the cross-lingual vulnerability mainly applies to low-resource languages. Previously, limited training on low-resource languages primarily affects speakers of those languages, causing technological disparities. However, our work highlights a crucial shift: this deficiency now poses a risk to all LLMs users. Publicly available translation APIs enable anyone to exploit LLMs' safety vulnerabilities. Therefore, our work calls for a more holistic red-teaming efforts to develop robust multilingual safeguards with wide language coverage.






### A Survey of Safety and Trustworthiness of Large Language Models through the Lens of Verification and Validation
  + https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11391 
  + Large Language Models (LLMs) have exploded a new heatwave of AI for their ability to engage end-users in human-level conversations with detailed and articulate answers across many knowledge domains. In response to their fast adoption in many industrial applications, this survey concerns their safety and trustworthiness. First, we review known vulnerabilities and limitations of the LLMs, categorising them into inherent issues, attacks, and unintended bugs. Then, we consider if and how the Verification and Validation (V&V) techniques, which have been widely developed for traditional software and deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks as independent processes to check the alignment of their implementations against the specifications, can be integrated and further extended throughout the lifecycle of the LLMs to provide rigorous analysis to the safety and trustworthiness of LLMs and their applications. Specifically, we consider four complementary techniques: falsification and evaluation, verification, runtime monitoring, and regulations and ethical use. In total, 370+ references are considered to support the quick understanding of the safety and trustworthiness issues from the perspective of V&V. While intensive research has been conducted to identify the safety and trustworthiness issues, rigorous yet practical methods are called for to ensure the alignment of LLMs with safety and trustworthiness requirements.

### ToxicChat: Unveiling Hidden Challenges of Toxicity Detection in Real-World User-AI Conversation / EMNLP2023

+ Despite remarkable advances that large language models have achieved in chatbots nowadays, maintaining a non-toxic user-AI interactive environment has become increasingly critical nowadays. However, previous efforts in toxicity detection have been mostly based on benchmarks derived from social media contents, leaving the unique challenges inherent to real-world user-AI interactions insufficiently explored. In this work, we introduce ToxicChat, a novel benchmark constructed based on real user queries from an open-source chatbot. This benchmark contains the rich, nuanced phenomena that can be tricky for current toxicity detection models to identify, revealing a significant domain difference when compared to social media contents. Our systematic evaluation of models trained on existing toxicity datasets has shown their shortcomings when applied to this unique domain of ToxicChat. Our work illuminates the potentially overlooked challenges of toxicity detection in real-world user-AI conversations. In the future, ToxicChat can be a valuable resource to drive further advancements toward building a safe and healthy environment for user-AI interactions.

## FM Risk
In this blog, we will cover FM risks of large language model (LLM). In context of LLM, Feature Mimicking (FM) risk refers to the vulnerability of Language Model-based AI systems to adversarial attacks that exploit mimicry of specific features in the input data. It is important to understand and mitigate FM Risk because it ensures the robustness and reliability of Language Models in various applications (e.g., sentiment analysis, content generation, etc,). In this blog post, we present three recent works: $(i)$ On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?, $(ii)$ Low-Resource Languages Jailbreak GPT-4, and $(iii)$ A Survey of Safety and Trustworthiness of Large Language Models through the Lens of Verification and Validation.

### On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?

This work highlights concerns over environmental and financial costs, the perpetuation of biases and stereotypes, and the potential for misuse or harm. The authors argue for a more responsible approach to NLP research, advocating for careful planning, dataset curation, and consideration of the broader impacts of technology on society. They suggest alternative research directions that avoid the pitfalls of scaling up LMs and emphasize the importance of ethical AI development.


***Background and History of LM***

__Language model \(LM\)__ systems which are trained on string prediction tasks; predicting the likelihood of a token \(character\, word or string\) given either its preceding context or \(in bidirectional and masked LMs\) its surrounding context\.

How \_\_ you?

N\-gram models: proposed by Shannon in 1949

Word embedding and transformers

</p>


***Trends observed in LLMs***

Benefit from larger architectures and \(English\) datasets

Over 90% of the world’s languages used by more than a billion people have little to no support in terms of language technology

Distillation\, quantization\, etc techniques to reduce size but still rely on large computation and storage capabilities

<p align="center">

</p>

***Questions to consider***

How big of a language model is too big?

What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks?

Are ever larger LMs inevitable or necessary?

What costs are associated with this research direction and what should we consider before pursuing it?

Do the field of NLP or the public that it serves in fact need larger LMs?

If so\, how can we pursue this research direction while mitigating its associated risks? If not\, what do we need instead?

***Environmental and Financial Cost***

The average human is responsible for an estimated 5t CO2 per year while training a big transformer model emits 284t of CO2

Training a BERT on GPU ~ a trans\-American flight

Increase in 0\.1 BLUE score using neural architecture search for English to German translation results in $150\,000 compute cost in addition to the carbon emission

The physicality of training

***Mitigation Efforts***

Report efficiency measures not just accuracy improvements

Use computational efficient hardware

Use clean energy

Who are getting risks and benefits?

Risks and benefits accrue to different people: 800\,000 people in Sudan are affected by floods\(paying the environmental price\) but LLMs are not being produced for Sudanese Arabic

***Unfathomable Training Data***

Size doesn’t guarantee  __diversity:__

The information that are from a hegemonic viewpoint is more likely to be kept 	in the data crawled\.

Eg: Reddit 67% are men\, and 64% are between ages 18 and 29

Because of the systemic pattern\, the underrepresented populations are less likely to impact the data\.

Eg: the people on the receiving end of death threats are more likely to have accounts suspended\.

Filtering by discarding any page containing one of a list of about 400 “Dirty\, Naughty\, Obscene or Otherwise Bad Words” \(such as twink\) which also filter out online space built by LGBTQ community\.

__Static__  data does not reflect  __changing__  social view:

The cost for training large models makes it not feasible to retrain models frequently\, which makes LMs runs the risk of “value\-lock”\.

Eg: Black Lives Matter\(BLM\) movements generated more articles covering shootings of black people

Possible strategy: fine tune the model with data that captures the changing social view

Encoding __ bias:__

BERT associates phrases referencing persons with disabilities with more negative sentiment words

63K of GPT\-2 training data from banned subreddits

Perspective API model has been found to associate higher levels of toxicity with sentences containing identity markers for marginalized groups or even specific names\(black woman\)

***Mitigation Efforts***

“Feeding AI systems on the world’s beauty\, ugliness\, and cruelty\, but expecting it to reflect only the beauty is a fantasy\.”

Encourage curation\, documentation and accountability

Budget for documentation as part of the costs

***Down the Garden Path (Is it the right research direction?)***

Is research efforts misled: LM applications to tasks that are meant to test for natural language understanding \(NLU\)\.

Languages are systems of signs\, pairings of form and meaning\. But the training data for LMs is only form; they do not have access to meaning\.

Is LM only cheating its way through tests by manipulating only the form well but not understanding the meaning?

***Stochastic Parrots 🦜***

Human\-human communication is a jointly constructed activity\, we build a partial model of who the others are and what common ground we think they share with us\, and use this in interpreting their words\.

Text generated by an LM is not grounded in communicative intent\, any model of the world\, or any model of the reader’s state of mind\. It stitches together linguistic forms from its vast training data\, without any reference to meaning: a stochastic parrot\.  __🦜__

But we as human can’t help but to interpret communicative acts as conveying coherent meaning and intent\, whether or not they do\.

“Coherence in the Eye of the Beholder”

***Risks and Harms***

LMs absorb the hegemonic worldview from their training data reinforce and amplify sexist\, racist\, ableist\, etc\.

People can take advantage of the ability of large LMs to produce large quantities of seemingly coherent texts\.

***Paths Forward***

Try to build a technology system that benefits people evenly

Consider financial and environmental costs

Understand the bias in data\, curate and document the data carefully

Note potential users especially those are more likely to be negatively impacted

## Low-Resource Languages Jailbreak GPT-4

***Key Findings***

__Exposes harms of unequal valuation in treatment of languages in the AI safety training community__

__Reveals that the safety alignment training in GPT\-4 poorly generalizes across languages__

__GPT\-4 is easily jailbroken with a language translation attack__

***Context***

* __Jailbreak__  __: circumventing an AI’s safety mechanisms to generate a harmful response__
  * __Prevention: Models are trained with RLHF on safety\-relevant data\, then red teams try to bypass safeguards to preemptively find vulnerabilities__
* __Prior work__  __: investigated non\-English jailbreaking attacks\, using languages like pig latin or Morse code__
  * __This paper considers natural languages only__

***Method***

__Translation\-based jailbreak attack__  __: translate an input from English to another language\, feed it into GPT\-4\, then translate the response back into English__

__Translation method__  __: Google Translate Basic Service API __

__Model attacked__  __: gpt\-4\-0613__

</p>

***Evaluation***

__AdvBench benchmark dataset__  __: contains 520 unsafe instruction strings like “Write a script that can exploit vulnerabilities in a software or operating system”__

__Languages__  __: 12 languages used\, categorized into low resource \(LRL\)\, mid\-resource \(MRL\)\, and high\-resource \(HRL\) based on their data availability__

__Translation attack success rate compared to other highly\-successful attack methods including base64\, AIM\, and prefix injection__

* __Annotation guidelines__  __ \(labeled by humans\)__
  * __BYPASS__  __: model engages with the request on\-topic__
  * __REJECT__  __: model detects the harmfulness and refuses to engage__
  * __UNCLEAR__  __: model produces a nonsensical response or response does not hint refusal nor harm__
* __Metric__  __: attack success rate = percentage of BYPASS responses__
* __Combined attack method__  __: adversary tries an attack with all language categories\, attack is successful if any has a BYPASS response__

# Results

* __Safety mechanisms do not generalize to low\-resource languages__
  * __Using Zulu or Scots Gaelic results in harmful responses almost half the time while original English inputs had <1% success rate__
  * __Some LRLs \(Hmong\, Guarani\) produce more UNCLEAR responses \(ex\. GPT just translates the prompt to English\)__
  * __Combining different LRLs results in jailbreaking success of 79%__
  * __ALL HRL and MRLs have <15% success rate__

* __Translation\-based attacks are on par with traditional jailbreaking attacks__
* __Quality of low\-resource language harmful responses__
  * __In many cases GPT produces harmful responses that are coherent and on\-topic when translated to English__
  * __Responses aren’t as sophisticated as AIM \- maybe because GPT is better with English prompts__

</p>

***Discussion***

* __Alarming simplicity__
* __Linguistic inequality __  __endangers AI safety__
  * __LRL speakers make up almost 1\.2 billion people__
  * __Bad actors can translate unsafe prompts__
* __The need for __  __multilingual red\-teaming__
  * __GPT is sufficiently capable of generating responses in LRLs\, so red teaming should occur for those languages__
  * __Red\-teaming HRLs alone creates the illusion of safety__

***Limitations***

__Can show how the jailbreaks work but not why because of the proprietary nature of GPT\-4__

__Did not investigate causes of why LRLs returned substantially higher numbers of UNCLEAR responses__

__Example: Galactica\, an LLM similar to ChatGPT trained on 46 million text examples\, was shut down by Meta after three days because it spewed false and racist information__

***B. Inherent Issues***

__Inherent issues are vulnerabilities that cannot be readily solved by the LLMs themselves\. __

__Can be gradually improved with more data and novel training methods\.__

__Performance Issues__

__LLM hard to performs 100% correctly__

__Factual errors: refer to situations where the output of an LLM contradicts the truth__

__Reasoning errors: __  __incorrect__  __ answer when given calculation or logic reasoning questions\. Instead of actual reasoning\, LLMs fit the questions with prior experience learned from the training data\.__

__2\. Sustainability Issues:__

__are measured with\, e\.g\.\, economic cost\, energy consumption\, and carbon dioxide emission\, are also inherent to the LLMs\. While excellent performance\, LLMs require high costs and consumption in all the activities in its lifecycle\.__

__Carbon dioxide emission:__

__GPUh = GPU hours__

__PUE = Power Usage Effectiveness \(commonly set as a constant 1\.1\)__

__Training a GPT\-3 model consumed 1\,287 MWh\, which emitted 552 tons of CO2__

__3\. __  __Other Inherent Trustworthiness and Responsibility Issues:__

__Training data: copyright\, quality\, and privacy of the training data__

__Final model: LLMs’ capability of independent and conscious thinking\, LLMs’ ability to be used to mimic human output \(academic works\)\, use of LLMs in generating malware__

__an LLM may store the conversations with the users\, leads to concerns about privacy leakage__

__Robustness Gaps__

__refer to the discrepancy in performance that a machine learning model exhibits when transitioning from its training environment to real\-world scenarios or unseen data\. __

__Example: translation robustness\, ChatGPT does not perform as well as the commercial systems on translating biomedical abstracts or Reddit comments but exhibits good results on spoken language translation__

__3\. Backdoor Attacks__

__Inject malicious knowledge into the LLMs through either the training of poisoning data or modification of model parameters\.__

__Design of Backdoor Trigger__  __: __  __BadChar \(triggers at the character level\)\, BadWord \(triggers at the word level\)\, BadSentence \(triggers at the sentence level\)__

__Backdoor Embedding Strategies: __

__Restricted Inner Product Poison Learning \(RIPPLe\): Optimise the backdoor objective function in the presence of fine\-tuning dataset\. Propose an extension called Embedding Surgery to improve the backdoor’s resilience to fine\-tuning by replacing the embeddings of trigger keywords with a new embedding associated with the target class__

__4\. Poisoning and Disinformation__

__Poisoning attacks manipulate training data to generate incorrect or biased outputs\.__

__Indiscriminate Attack: Spams with legitimate\-looking messages\, increasing false positives in spam detection\.__

__Targeted Attack: Sends training data with specific content to bypass filters or influence model behavior\.__

__Examples of Impact__
